[id="fips-mode-CR_{context}"]
= FIPS mode for your `Infinispan` CR

[role="_abstract"]
The {openshiftplatform} can use certain Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) components that ensure {openshiftshort} clusters meet the requirements of a FIPS compliance audit.

If you enabled FIPS mode on your {openshiftshort} cluster then the {ispn_operator} automatically enables FIPS mode for your `Infinispan` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Client certificate authentication is not currently supported with FIPS mode. Attempts to create `Infinispan` CR with `spec.security.endpointEncryption.clientCert` set to a value other than `None` will fail.

= Disabling FIPS mode in your `Infinispan` CR

The {openshiftplatform} can use certain Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) components that ensure {openshiftshort} clusters meet the requirements of a FIPS compliance audit. 
This might cause issues when you want your {brandname} instance to run on any {openshiftshort} cluster that has FIPS mode enabled. 
{brandname} {ProductVersion} does not support FIPS mode, so you must disable FIPS mode in your `Infinispan` CR.

After you disable FIPS mode in your `Infinispan` CR, any component that uses a JVM, such as {brandname} Server, {brandname} CLI, or Gossip router, ignores FIPS mode. 
This happens, because the JVM no longer loads FIPS-related cryptographic libraries on implementation startup. 

[NOTE]
====
{openshiftshort} might disable FIPS mode by default.
You need to explicitly disable FIPS mode in your `Infinispan` CR configuration only if FIPS mode is enabled for an {openshiftshort} cluster.
====

.Prerequisites
* Created `Infinispan` CR on {openshiftshort}, so that your {ispn_operator} can interact with {openshiftshort}. 

.Procedure
. Configure JVM options with the `spec.container` field in your `Infinispan` CR. 
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::yaml/disable_fips_cr.yaml[]
----

. Apply your `Infinispan` CR.
